        <h1>>Wonderful World / Louis Armstrong </h1>  <br>
        I see trees of green, <br>
        Red roses too <br>
        I see them bloom <br>
        For me and you <br>
        And I think to myself, <br>
        What a wonderful world <br>
    </div>  
    <div>
        -------------- <br>
        I see skies of blue <br>
        And clouds of white, <br>
        The bright blessed day, <br>
        The dark sacred night <br>
        And I think to myself, <br>
        What a wonderful world <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        -------------- <br>
        The colors of the rainbow<br>
        So pretty in the sky<br>
        Are also on the faces<br>
        Of people going by<br>
        I see friends shaking hands,<br>
        Saying: "How do you do?"<br>
        They're really saying<br>
        "I love you"<br>
    </div>
    <div>
        -------------- <br>
        I hear babies crying, <br>
        I watch them grow <br>
        They'll learn much more, <br>
        than I'll never know <br>
        And I think to myself, <br>
        What a wonderful world <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        -------------- <br>
        Yes, I think to myself, <br>
        What a wonderful world <br>
